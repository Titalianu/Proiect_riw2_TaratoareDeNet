The read blocks indefinitely until there is at least one byte to read. If length is -1, keep reading until the socket is closed from the other end (This is known as EXHAUSTIVE mode in the http server code). This method should only be used inside Connection Handlers. Note: The behaviour of this method has changed since version 3.0.3. In 3.0.3 and prior, this method would block until length bytes was read. readline( [length]) Reads a line from the connection or up to length bytes. This method should only be used inside Connection Handlers. write( string) Writes string to the client. This method should only be used inside Connection Handlers. Mod_python Manual
