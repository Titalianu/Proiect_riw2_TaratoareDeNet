A filter must be closed once the EOS has been encountered. If the len argument is negative or omitted, reads all data currently available. readline( [length]) Reads a line from the next filter or up to length bytes. write( string) Writes string to the next filter. flush( ) Flushes the output by sending a FLUSH bucket. close( ) Closes the filter and sends an EOS bucket. Any further IO operations on this filter will throw an exception. disable( ) Tells mod_python to ignore the provided handler and just pass the data on. Used internally by mod_python to print traceback from exceptions encountered in filter handlers to avoid an infinite loop.
