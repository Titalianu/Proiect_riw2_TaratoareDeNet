Mod_python Manual Previous: 6.1.2.1 Traversal Up: 6.1.2 The Publishing Algorithm Next: 6.1.2.3 Authentication 6.1.2.2 Argument Matching and Invocation Once the destination object is found, if it is callable and not a class, the Publisher handler will get a list of arguments that the object expects. This list is compared with names of fields from HTML form data submitted by the client via POST or GET. Values of fields whose names match the names of callable object arguments will be passed as strings. Any fields whose names do not match the names of callable argument objects will be silently dropped, unless the destination callable object has a **kwargs style argument, in which case fields with unmatched names will be passed in the **kwargs argument. If the destination is not callable or is a class, then its string representation is returned to the client.
